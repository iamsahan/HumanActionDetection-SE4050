HumanActionDetection-SE4050 – Deep Learning Based Human Action Recognition

This project demonstrates the development of a deep learning-based Human Action Detection (HAD) system.
Using a dataset of 18,000+ labeled images across 15 activity classes, the system leverages multiple deep learning models to classify human actions with high accuracy.
The project was completed as part of the SE4050 – Deep Learning module (July 2025).
